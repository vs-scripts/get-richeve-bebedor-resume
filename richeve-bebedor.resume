1.  SUMMARY

This document specifies the professional profile of Richeve S. Bebedor,
a senior-level Node.js backend engineer with over a decade of experience
designing APIs, distributed systems, and automation platforms. The
author specializes in TypeScript-based backend services, background
processing systems, cloud-integrated platforms, and reusable
infrastructure tooling.

Primary focus areas include scalable backend architecture, system
modularity, automation-first engineering, and performance-aware data and
media processing pipelines.

2.  CAREER STATUS

This document represents a stable description of production-level
engineering capabilities demonstrated across startup, enterprise, and
contract environments. The intended audience includes engineering teams,
system architects, and technical recruiters evaluating backend and
platform engineering roles.

3.  ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

The author follows these engineering principles when designing systems:

-   Systems MUST be modular, observable, and testable
-   APIs SHOULD be stateless and versioned
-   Background processing MUST be fault-tolerant and concurrency-aware
-   Infrastructure SHOULD be automated and reproducible
-   Integrations MUST include resilience patterns (retries, logging,
    rate handling)

4.  TECHNICAL SCOPE DEFINITIONS

Backend System: Server-side services responsible for APIs, business
logic, and data processing.

Distributed Processing: Workloads executed across multiple workers,
threads, or services to improve throughput and reliability.

Worker Pipeline: Background job architecture used for CPU or I/O
intensive processing such as media transformation.

Integration Layer: Abstraction layer responsible for communication with
third-party APIs and external services.

Automation Tooling: CLI or programmatic utilities used to streamline
operational or developer workflows.
