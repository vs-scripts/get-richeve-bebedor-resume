    Focus areas: distributed systems, APIs, automation, cloud platforms.

5.  Engineering Principles:

    The author follows these engineering principles when designing systems:

    - Systems MUST be modular, observable, and testable
    - APIs SHOULD be stateless and versioned
    - Background processing MUST be fault-tolerant and concurrency-aware
    - Infrastructure SHOULD be automated and reproducible
    - Integrations MUST include resilience patterns such as retries, logging,
      and rate handling
