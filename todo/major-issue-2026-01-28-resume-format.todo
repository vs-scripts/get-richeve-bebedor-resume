0. METADATA ✅ (Keep — This is your header) Tweak content to be career-focused: 0. METADATA: - RFC: CONCISE-RFC-RESUME - GROUP: PROFESSIONAL PROFILE - TITLE: BACKEND ENGINEER PROFILE - ACRONYM: RBENG - AUTHOR: RICHEVE BEBEDOR <richeve.bebedor@gmail.com> - CATEGORY: INFORMATIONAL - STATUS: STABLE - VERSION: 000001 (1.0.0) - CREATED: 2026-01-28 - CHECKSUM: <SHA-256> This instantly signals: “This person thinks like a systems engineer.” 1. Summary ✅ → Your Professional Summary Replace abstract with career overview: Purpose: Who you are, what you specialize in, scale of experience. Example direction: Years of Node.js experience Backend & distributed systems focus Cloud + processing + APIs 2. Permission ⚠️ Optional For a resume, this can be simplified or removed. If kept, repurpose as: Permission to share for evaluation, interviews, and professional review. 3. Contents ✅ Keep Still useful and reinforces the RFC feel. 4. Document Status 🔁 → Career Status Instead of RFC lifecycle, define career positioning: Example: This document describes the professional capabilities of a senior-level backend engineer Focus areas: distributed systems, APIs, automation, cloud platforms Intended audience: engineering teams, technical recruiters, system architects 5. Normative Language 🔁 → Engineering Principles Replace RFC2119 rules with how you build software Example: Systems MUST be modular and testable APIs SHOULD be stateless and observable Background processing MUST be fault-tolerant Infrastructure SHOULD be automated This section becomes your engineering philosophy. 6. Naming Conventions 🔁 → Technical Scope Definitions Define what you mean by terms: Backend System Distributed Processing Worker Pipeline API Integration Layer Automation Tooling This shows architectural thinking. 7. Structure 🔁 → Core Competencies (VERY IMPORTANT SECTION) This becomes your skills section, but structured like a system spec. Break into subsections: 7.1 Core Languages Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript 7.2 Backend Architecture NestJS, Express, Fastify, REST APIs, microservices 7.3 Data Systems PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sequelize 7.4 Distributed & Background Processing Worker Threads, queues, FFmpeg pipelines, concurrency 7.5 Cloud & Infrastructure AWS (S3, Lambda, SNS), Azure, Docker, Nginx, PM2 7.6 Integration & Automation Payment APIs, media APIs, auth providers, CLI tooling Now your skills look like subsystems of a platform, not a random list. ➕ ADD NEW SECTIONS (Critical for Resume) Your FORMAT allows structure — we just add career-relevant sections. 8. Professional Experience Each job becomes a system implementation record Use this pattern: Role — Company (Dates) System Type: (e.g., Enterprise Planning Platform) Responsibilities: Designed… Implemented… Optimized… Technologies: Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS… Impact: Improved… Reduced… Enabled… This aligns perfectly with your RFC tone. 9. Selected System Implementations This replaces “projects” and highlights engineering showcases, not student apps. Examples tailored for you: Distributed media processing pipelines Transport booking platform architecture API integration frameworks Background worker orchestration systems Describe each like a mini system spec. 10. Open Source & Tooling Contributions This is where your 400+ repos and 200+ NPM packages shine. But frame them as: Reusable backend infrastructure modules Automation utilities Data processing libraries Developer tooling Not “many small repos” → but ecosystem contribution 11. System Architecture Philosophy You already wrote this in your previous RFC resume — reuse it. This is GOLD for senior roles. 12. Education Short. Clean. At the end. Senior engineers are hired for experience, not coursework.
